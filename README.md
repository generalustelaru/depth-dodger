# Depth Dodger

It's Minesweeper, but underwater: 

Includes:
- Classic Minesweeper setup
- Safe first click
- Two flagging modes -- one prevents accidental clicks and counts as a mine while the other doesn't do anything
- Bubble Drink: A little help in tough situations and the saving grace for unnatentive players -- like myself
- Cute looks (but I'm biased)
