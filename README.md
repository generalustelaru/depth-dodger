# Depth Dodger

It's Minesweeper, but underwater.

Includes:
- Fully playable game
- Two flagging modes -- one prevents accidental clicks and counts as a mine while the other doesn't do anything
- Soothing Serum: A little help in tough situations and the saving grace for unnatentive players -- like myself
- Cute looks (but I'm biased)
